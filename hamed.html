 <h1>*Types of Intel processors in order</h1>     
    <div>
        <h3>1. The economy category for simple tasks</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>*These processors are designed for internet browsing, studying, and using Office applications.</li>
        <li>.Intel Celeron: The least expensive and least powerful, suitable for very basic tasks.</li>
        <li>.Intel Pentium: Slightly better than Celeron, good for educational laptops.</LI>
        <li>.Intel Processor: The new name Intel recently introduced to replace Pentium and Celeron in modern devices.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
<hr>
    <div>
        <h3>2. General and Advanced Use Category Intel Core i</h3>
        <ul>   
            <li>*This is the most popular and widespread category, ranked as follows:</li>
            <li>Core i5: The mid-range and "value king", excellent for gaming, programming, and intensive daily work.</li>
            <li>Core i3: For home or office users: browsing, movies, light software.</li>
            <li>Core i7: For high performance, ideal for designers, heavy gamers, and content creators.</li>
            <li>Core i9: The pinnacle of performance in this series, designed for very demanding tasks such as 3D rendering and high-definition live streaming of games.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
<hr>

    <div>
         <h3>3. The new Intel Core Ultra series</h3>
            <ul> 
        <li>*Intel recently began using the Ultra designation for processors that contain Neural 
        Processing Units (NPUs) to support artificial intelligence and improve energy efficiency:</li>
        <li>Core Ultra 5</li>
        <li>Core Ultra 7</li>
        <li>Core Ultra 9</li>
            </ul>

            <li>Intel Xeon: It is not aimed at the average home user, but rather at workstations and servers,
         and is characterized by its ability to work for very long periods and support for huge RAM.</li>
             </ul>
   
         </div>
<hr>
    <div>
            <h3>*Important note about 'generations' and 'letters'When purchasing, the order alone is not enough; you need to pay attention to two things:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>.Generation: A 14th-generation i3 processor may be stronger than a 10th-generation i7 processor. Always look for newer generations such as 12th, 13th, or 14th.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
<hr>
    <span>
        <h3>*The letters at the end of the model:</h3>
        <ul>
                <li>U: Energy saver for long battery life in the laptop</li>
             <li>H / HX: High performance for gaming and editing on laptops</li>
              <li>K: Capable of overclocking for high-performance desktop devices</li>
             <li>F: Does not have an internal graphics card requires an external graphics card</li>
        </ul>
